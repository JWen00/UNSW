    abstract Data Types.. basically we don't know how it works, it just works.   

### lecture 2 - [Complexity](/COMP2521/lect02.md) 
    complexity of different algorithms and why it's so important.  

### lecture 3 - [Recusion](/COMP2521/lect03.md) 
    how to recurse, dis going to be in the final exam. 

### lecture 4 - [Trees](/COMP2521/lect04.md) 
    trees, binary trees, inserting trees, why are they do DAMN annoying trees. 

### lecture 5 - [Heaps](/COMP2521/lect05.md) 
    aka reinventing the tree --> heap.

### lecture 6 - [Directed Graphs](/COMP2521/lect06.md)
    graphs.. Yay discrete.

### lecture 7 - [Sorts](/COMP2521/lect07.md)
    bubble, selection, insertion, shell.. 

### lecture 8 - [Splay Trees](/COMP2521/lect08.md) 
    balanced btrees = splay trees.

### lecture 9 - [Hash Tables](/COMP2521/lect09.md) 
    yay fun stuff --> chaining, linear probing and double hashing..
