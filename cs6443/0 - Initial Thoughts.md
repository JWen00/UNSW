Am going to reuse this blog for cs6443 Web Security. I enrolled in the course without fully checking what it is about... I just thought it would be fun. Anyhow, some things it covers:

* Reconnaissance
* Relevant Tooling Used in Industry
* Server-side attacks, such as SQL injection and Local File Inclusion
* Client-Side vulnerabilities, such as Cross Site Scripting
* Authentication
* Session Management
* Access Control and Privilege Escalation
* Common web service vulnerabilities
* Patching and remediation
* Secure web coding best practice
* Vulnerability reporting and professional communication
* Pen-testing in Industry

It seems to me that all the security courses have a rather unorthordox method of teaching, requiring much much more self learning and time management than any other course. It can be extremely harsh to those used to the baby-sitting of regular core courses, but at the same time, the more you invest, the more you get in return.

Requirements

* CS6441 or CS3441 or CS9321
* Basic Understanding of HTML, CSS, JS, DB, Server-Side Scripting etc
* Moderate familiarity with Java, Python or PHP
* Basic knowledge of network and web related protocols

Overall, I feel quite scared because, although I pass the requirements, week 1 * seems like a huge slap to the face. No introduction, and even creating an account with Quakka bank leaves you racking ur brains.

I know I need this. So. Let's do it?
