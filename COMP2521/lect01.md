# ADT's (Abstract Data Types)

### Abstractions are important..
------
     Types include:
     * DT : (Non abstract) Data Types.
     * ADO : Abstract Data Object
     * ADT : Abstract Data Type
     * GADT : Generic Abstract Data Type

### But Specifically ADTS..
------
    Provide:
    * An opaque view of a data structure
    * function signitures for all operations
    * semantics of operations
    * contract between ADT and clients
    * function implementations for all operations

### On stacks and queues
------
    > A stack is a collection of items such that the *last* item to enter is the *first* item to leave

    > A queue is a collection of items such that the *first* item to enter is the *first* item to leave
