# Refactoring 

#### _..is the restructuring of code without changing it's external behaviour._

We refactor to remove or reduce the probability of **code smells**  

## Why? | Software Maintanance 

Involves: 
* Fixing bugs 
* Improving performance
* Improving design
* Adding feature 

## Where? | Code Smells 

* Duplicated code 
* Poor abstraction 
* Excessive loops, methods, class, parameters etc.
* Little cohesion
* High coupling 
* Poor encapsulation 
* Poor inheritance 
* Unused classes 

## How? | Low-Level 

* Names - Renaming 
* Procedures - Extracting code, functionality, method signitures 
* Reordering - Splitting one method into their own functionality
