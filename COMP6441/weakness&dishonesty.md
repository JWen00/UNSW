EDIT: This was really a rant. Gonna shorten this and cut to the chase xd

# Intro
Our notion of honesty varies greatly depending on our environment and values as we mature and enter society. I tend to trust blindly - I've lost my wallet 4 times, phone 3 times, and left my bag outside in the sun to dry but nothing has gone wrong. 

I trust that others to be honest, and hence, hold honesty as a important attribute. 

# White Lies 
However, our consideration for another person may result in white lies. I believe we shouldn't overcomplicate our systems to take into account of worrying about another's concerns and leave that part to their own construct?

# Lying to yourself
We often subconsciously alter a situation into one we like, believing things to fall into the same pattern as they always have, hence easily turning a blind eye to things to the small details which actually matter. 

As a consequence of our predispositions, it is difficult to break the ideas and already identified patterns of behaviour/results. 

Let's not form our own version of the truth so quickly and listen to each other. Our goal is not believe that things will go right because they always have but to check that things aren't going wrong.
