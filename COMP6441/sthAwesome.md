# Something Awesome 

This project further builds on my arguments, showing my ability to extend myself beyond classwork. Even though OWASP web vulnerabilities were discussed in the course activities, I was able to take it a step further with my research and technical component. 

As discussed in my [initial proposal](https://jennax-seceng.tumblr.com/post/185564313771/my-sth-awe-some), I planned to have a more theory and explanation, but as we were required to research the same things in the course, I decided to learn how to actually perform these injections. 


Unfortunately, due to time constraints I only managed to get the XSS Injection and Cookie Theft stealing session working whilst I balanced my time with another assignment due on the same day.  

I believe that I could have achieved more had I known that I was focusing on a more practical component and targeted different outcomes, as noted in my [proposal update](https://jennax-seceng.tumblr.com/post/186335530638/sth-awesome-update-2).
