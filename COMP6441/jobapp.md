Dear Gitzon Security and HR Team,

I am writing to express my interest the Security Engineer job listing. I believe I would be an appropriate candidate due to the factors outlined in the following pages.

* [Analytical Skills]() 
* [Time Management]()

They effectively demonstrate my professionalisml, ability to analyse critically, and most importantly, passion to ensure constant improvement and life-long learning.
