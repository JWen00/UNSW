# Time Management 

In the real world, time constrains and consequently, time management plays an important factor in determining success and professionalism. 

Although we are not required to complete 100% of the course activities, however to maximise the amount of work completed (even when there were other commitments in the picture), I had reflected and identified a strategy to prioritise and catch up.  

## Planning, Prioritizing and Problems
* [Initial Workload Plans](https://jennax-seceng.tumblr.com/post/185632931261/wk02-reflections) A detailed weekly plan of what I would try to achieve every week 
* [Mass Production of HMK posts](https://jennax-seceng.tumblr.com/post/185772795136/yes-its-hmk-spamming-time) Evidence of completing activiies early as I knew I had an assignment coming up
* [Catchup Plan](https://jennax-seceng.tumblr.com/post/186130348941/oh-boi) Catchup plan as I spend midterms studying for exams
* [Catcup Plan](https://jennax-seceng.tumblr.com/post/186414361296/halp-it-became-wk8) Catchup plan for week 7 content as final assignments which are both due in week 8
