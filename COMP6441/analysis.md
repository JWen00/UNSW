# Analysis 

Over the course of the term, my analytical abilitys saw a dramatic improvement. 

## Improvement in analysis skills
This is particularly evident when comparing the most recent analysis [Online Attacks](https://jennax-seceng.tumblr.com/post/186183989871/case-study-wk06)  and my first,  [Houdini](https://jennax-seceng.tumblr.com/post/185632647666/harrys-big-brain), where ideas mainly stemmed from peers whilst I struggled to come up with creative and quality ideas despite doing the pre-readings. 

As opposed to this, in the recent case study, I had clearly identified the relevant issues and estabilished clear, justified ideas which address them. Example: 

> _"**Sensitive data is to be re-classified**  
JUSTIFICAION - Data which is kept relatively public within todayâ€™s peaceful world may become very important and should be sensitive within a war-like situation."_

## Reflection
In addition, my ability to reflect saw an improvement towards the end of the term. This is demonstrated in the [Self Driven Cars Case study](https://jennax-seceng.tumblr.com/post/186183989871/case-study-wk06).  

> _"This case study has successfully allowed us to realise the importance of perspectives and taking into accounts of different interests of stakeholders."_

## Application and Research 
As later case studies did not offer pre-readings, I saw a significant decrease in the sophisitcation and depth of solutions developed. Pre-readings such as the [Co-Pilot Dilemma]((https://jennax-seceng.tumblr.com/post/185703542211/wk03-co-pilots-be-salty)) allowed us to extend our knowledge and learn from past examples, gain theoretical knowledge in which we are then able to convert into concrete ideas. 

> _**"Type II Error, not granding the right person access"**... targeted by estabilshing a protocol "Two people must be in the same cockpit at any given time"_
