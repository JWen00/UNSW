## Bits of Securty 
One 'bit' is the 'n' in 2^n. 

1. find probabiltiy 
2. approximate as a power of 2  
What it takes to break cipher 

###  Example 
How many bits of work does it take to crack a password (length 8) 
with a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and two more characters. 

==> 26 + 26 + 10 + 2 = 64
==> 64^8 
==> represent 64^8 in terms of 2^8
==> (2^6)^8 
==> 2^48 
==> 48 bits of work

# Design the security of a secret project site
## 1) Main things needing to be protected 
* Privacy of information 
* Accessibility of the site 
* Floorplans/Blueprints
* **INSIDER ATTACKS** 
* Methods to access the building 
    
## 2) Key features of security 

**Policies** 
* Ensure each guard knows the faces of the members - introduce members as they appear 
* Emailing information about the project to HQ must only come from one source, requires end-to-end decryption 
* Each person has a point of contact. They are only allowed to talk to one peron about the project, if they want to talk to another, they have to cycle through each person until it reaches the person intended. (Circle of flow). This way, noone can pretend to ask about it as someone else. This occurs outside of working hours. Does not apply while within site. Noone knows another person's point of contact.
* Noone uses their real name to talk to each other. 
* Security Guard cannot give permission to enter unless they have a tag, which is NOT created by HQ. It can only be created within the prescencse of other members


 Interception prolems 


**Physical Security** 
* Each engineer is provided a work laptop which they must leave at the facility 
* Access requires both the guard's ID and the worker's ID (i.e. workers cannot gain entry without the presensce of the guard)
* Delivery packages are checked for microphones/cameras
* Ensure there are no glass windows facing outwards 
* Keep the area of the site small so it can be patrolled easily
* In addition to security cameras, install vibration detecting tools on the floor which detect is someone is in an awkward location.  


## Other ideas

* Certain access times 
* two keycards required 
* deceitful expctations 
* tamper-proof 
* indiviaul networks
* Drive in drive out don't know who came 
* Insider attacks..
