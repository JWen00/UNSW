# Time Management 

In the real world, time constrains and consequently, time management plays an important factor in determining success and professionalism. 

Although we are not required to complete 100% of the course activities, however to maximise the amount of work completed (even when there were other commitments in the picture), I had reflected and identified a strategy to prioritise and catch up.
