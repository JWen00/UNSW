# (More Iterative) Software Development Methodologies 

> Revision:: Iterative Software Development Methodologies
> * approaches break big problems down  
> * after each iteration seek cusomter feedback 
> * seeks to get a working instance as soon as possible 
> * progressively understand or viaulise the product  

Some examples include: 
* Rational Unified Process 
* Agile methodologies (XP, SCRUM) 
* Unified Software development process  

### Rational Unified Process (RUP)
Uses an iterative approach and has 4 major phases

* **Inception**

Scope and identify major players, recourses, architecture risks and estimate costs 

* **Elaboration**

Understanding problem in detail 

* **Construction**

 Design, build and test

* **Transition**

Release software to production

Note: Does all the life-cycle steps at the same time (when required)

#### Some include: 
* Scrum
* DSDM
