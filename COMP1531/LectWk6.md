# (More Iterative) Software Development Methodologies 

> Revision:: Iterative Software Development Methodologies
> * approaches break big problems down  
> * after each iteration seek cusomter feedback 
> * seeks to get a working instance as soon as possible 
> * progressively understand or viaulise the product  

Some examples include: 
* Rational Unified Process 
* Agile methodologies (XP, SCRUM) 
* Unified Software development process  

## Rational Unified Process (RUP)
Uses an iterative approach and has 4 major phases

* **Inception**

Scope and identify major players, recourses, architecture risks and estimate costs 

* **Elaboration**

Understanding problem in detail 

* **Construction**

 Design, build and test

* **Transition**

Release software to production

Note: Does all the life-cycle steps at the same time (when required)

## Agile Software Methodologies

### Agile development values: 
* Individuals and **interactions** over processes and tools 
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation 
* Customer **collaboration** over contract negotiation 
* **Responding to change** over following a plan 

#### Some include: 
* Scrum
* DSDM 
* FDD 
* XP 
* Crystal 
* Lean 

#### Benefits? 

* Increased productivity 
* Increased quality 
* Improve stakeholder satisfaction
* Reduced costs 

### Extreme Programing (XP) 

#### Concepts 
* Focuses on providing highest value in shortest duration of time
* Acknowledges and **expects changes** to requirements 
* Places value on **adaptability** over predictability 
* Aims to **lower the cost** of change by introducing basic principles

Basic principals include:   
High quality, simple design and continuous feedback to bring flexibility 

High Quality
* Pair-programming (one codes, one reviews) 
* Continuous Integration
* Sustainable pace 
* Open workspace
* Refactoring 
* Test-Driven Development 

Simple Design
* Focus on sturies in current iteration
* Migrate design from iteration to iteration 
* Spike solutions/prototypes 

#### Key steps in XP planning 
* Initial Exploration 

Create user stories/estimate and schedule 
* Release Plan 

Negotiate a release date, use project velocity to plan time and scope  

* Iteration Planning 

Iteration size is 1 or 2 weeks   
Changes cannot be made during the iteration   
Iteration ends on a specific date   

* Task planning 

Client chose user stories to be completed for the iteration   
User stories broken down to programming tasks   
Each task is given an estimated time  
Reference to project velocity to see if overbooked for the iteration 

#### Agile drawbacks
* Daily standup meetings 
* Emphasis on modeularity, incremental debelopment 
* Adaptability not suited for clients desiring contracts with firm estimates 
* Reliance on small-self-orgnansed teams 
* Lack of comprehensive documentation makes it difficult to maintain/takeover
* Agile development needs highly experienced software engineers 

#### When to use XP? 
* Useful for problem domains where requirements change and/or clients do not have a firm idea of what they want 
* XP addresses project risk 
* Suitable for project group sizes of 2-12 
* Requires extended development team 
* Emphases on testability and creating automated unit and acceptance tests
* XP delovers greater productivity
