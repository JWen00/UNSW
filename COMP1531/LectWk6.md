# (More) Software Development Methodologies 

1. Waterfall Model (1970s)
--- 
* Performing each development one at a time.  
* Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment and maintenance.  
* Unique identity: once you have finished an aprt, you cannot go back to modify it. 

2. Incremental and Iterative Project Life-Cycle 
---
* Breaks the big problem down and prioritises each step 
* Seeks client feedback after each iteration or increment 
* Aims to progressively deeping the understanding or "visualisation" of a product to get a working instance as soon as possible 

3. Rational Unified Process (RUP)
---
* Uses an iterative approach and has 4 major phases
* **Inception**: scope and identify major players, recourses, architecture risks and estimate costs 
* **Elaboration**: Understanding problem in detail 
* **Construction** Design, build and test
* **Transition**: release software to production

4. Agile Software Methodologies
---
Agile development values: 
* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools 
* Working software over comprehensive documentation 
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation 
* Responding to change over following a plan
