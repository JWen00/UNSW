## Software Development Phases
--- 

The **methodology** is a *framework* to structure plan and control teh development of the softeware system.    

## Software Development Approaches
--- 

Agile Method: Breaking things down into smaller components to solve (Kinda like divide and conquer) 

The phases are:  
  * Analysis and Specification 
  * Design
  * Implementation
  * Testing 
  * Release and Maintenance  
  
## Software Implementation Approaches  
---

  * Parallel 
  * Phased
  * Pilot (Using a smaller audience) 
  * Direct 
  
  
## Waterfall Model (1970s) 
---

  * Is a linear sequential project life-cycle characterised by detailed planning:    
        1. Problem is identified, documented and designed 
        2. Implementation tasks identified, scoped and scheduled 
        3. Development cycle followed by testing cycle
  * Once a task is completed and documented, you cannot go back to the same task 
  * Project visibility 
  * Suitable for **stable** products (those with well known requirements)  
  * Rigid, not flexible and not possible for fine tuning 

## Software Development Challenges 
---

Software is: 
  * Complex 
  * Intangible 
  * Flexible 


## Incremental and Iterative Project Life-Cycle 
---

These approaches break big problems down   

**Interation** refers to a step in the life-cycle

After each iteration, you seek cusomter feedback and change the course based on improved understanding   

It seeks to get a working instance as soon as possible and progressively understand or viaulise the product
