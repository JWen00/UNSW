# Revision Questions 

### Describe the importance of software engineering to software development 

* Software engineering aims to develop value to the customer by ensuring a good understanding of the problem domain.  

* Software engineering creates a creative forumulation of ideas to solve the problem based on the problem domain 

* Software engineering breaks down the software development process through its clearly defined requirements engineering phase. 

* Software engineering ensures that software is good, that is, it is not only functional but easily maintable. 

* Software engineering allows for clear structured code. (Software architecture) 
### What are 3 differences betweeen waterfall and agile? 

1. Once code has been submitted for an iteration, in a waterfall methodology, it cannot be touched again. However, in AGILE methodology, it can be changed/refactored 

> Waterfall model follows linear sequential model (requirements/analysis/design/implementation/resting). Each phase must be completed before starting on the next. However, in an AGILE model, all the phases are traversed through within each iteration. 

2. Agile goes through the process of life cycles (analysis/requirements/design/implementation/testing) within each iteration while waterfall focuses on each stage at a time. 

> Kinda the same as 1. 

Another one would be: 
> Waterfall model: Rigid, not open to change in requirements 
> Agile: Flexible and can adjust to change in requirements between iterations 

3. Waterfall does not seek customer feedback while agile methods seek customer feedback to further improve/change design requirements 

* AGILE: Continous client involvement throughout the life-cycle 
Waterfall: Customer is involved only in the beginning and end 

### In O-O Design, explan the meaning of encapsulation and state its benefits 

Encapsulation is hiding the state of an object. 

In Python, this means having private functions/attributes and public attributes. This way, object values cannot be changed directly and must go through an internal process. 

This allows: 
* security 
* less unpredictability of an oject  

### What are the benefits of creating a CRC? 

CRC referrs to Class Responsibility Cards. These cards help us build our UML-Class diagrams as they allow us to brainstorm which classes interact and the methods they require.
